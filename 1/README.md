# Advent of Code 2024 in Odin
This year was a toss-up between [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) and [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/). Odin
won, mostly because I felt I needed to become more familiar with its libraries, and to get more
practice in data-oriented programming and memory management. Also, it feels like a language that
would be well suited to solving programming puzzles â€“ I'll probably form a stronger opinion about
this as I go along.

I'll have to see how far I get this year round. In the past I've only lasted a week or two before
the end-of-year demands at work crowded out time for recreational programming.
